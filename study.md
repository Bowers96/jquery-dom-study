# jQuery Study

## Required Readings

-   [The DOM | Wikipedia](https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Document_Object_Model)

-   [The DOM | CSS-Tricks](https://css-tricks.com/dom/). You may **ignore**
    these sections if you wish: "JavaScript can manipulate the DOM" and "Ajax
    and Templating".

-   [Try jQuery](http://try.jquery.com/). You only need to complete level 1.

-   [Check out this video](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=n1cKlKM3jYI). The
point is to get to think about the DOM as a tree! The DOM is not source and
it's also not a rendered page.

## jQuery !== ?

Please name two things the DOM is not.

```md
It is not the code you type inside your text editor and it is not the code you
see in the source when you are inspecting.
```

Is the information inside your Dev Tools the DOM? Why or why not?

```md
Yes, the DOM is in your Dev Tools because they are the tools to help
build/fix a webpage you are someone else is building. The DOM is to give
more of a visual aspect to how your website is structured when you might be
making changes or just want to look at a different perspective of a webpage.
```

In your own words, why do you think the DOM is important?

```md
The DOM gives you a visual aspect that lets you see the hierarchey of your
webpage allowing you to manipulate parts of your code when needed.
```
